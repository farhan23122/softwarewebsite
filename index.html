  <h2>What is Front End?</h2>
  <br>
<br>
  <h4>
    Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the practice of producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly. The challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and techniques used to create the front end of a website change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is developing.
    <br>
    <br>
    The objective of designing a site is to ensure that when the users open up the site they see the information in a format that is easy to read and relevant. This is further complicated by the fact that users now use a large variety of devices with varying screen sizes and resolutions thus forcing the designer to take into consideration these aspects when designing the site. They need to ensure that their site comes up correctly in different browsers (cross-browser), different operating systems (cross-platform) and different devices (cross-device), which requires careful planning on the side of the developer.
    <br>
    <br>
    HTML, CSS, & JavaScript: A front-end developer architects and develops websites and applications using web technologies (i.e., HTML, CSS, DOM, and JavaScript), which run on the Open Web Platform or act as compilation input for non-web platform environments (i.e., React Native). Image source: https://www.upwork.com/hiring/development/front-end-developer/ Typically, a person enters into the field of front-end development by learning to develop HTML, CSS, and JavaScript which commonly runs in a web browser but can also run in a headless browser, WebView, or as compilation input for a native runtime environment. These four run times scenarios are explained below.

  <h2>What is Backend?</h2>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h4>
    Back-end Development refers to the server-side development. It focuses on databases, scripting, website architecture. It contains behind-the-scene activities that occur when performing any action on a website. It can be an account login or making a purchase from an online store. Code written by back-end developers helps browsers to communicate with database information. Example: Most common example of Backend programming is when you are reading an article on the blog. The fonts, colors, designs, etc. constitute the frontend of this page. While the content of the article is rendered from a server and fetched from a database. This is the backend part of the application. In this tutorial, you will learn What is Backend Development? Skills You Need to Become a Backend Developer Roles and Responsibilities of Backend Developer Frontend Developer Vs. Backend Developer Skills You Need to Become a Backend Developer Backend Developer Skills Backend Developer Skills Following are the skills you require to become a back end developer: Web Development Languages Database and Cache Server API (REST & SOAP) Web Development Languages: Backend engineer should know at least one server-side or Backend programming language like Java, Python, Ruby, . Net etc. Database and Cache: Knowledge of various DBMS technology is one of the important Backend developer skills. MySQL, MongoDB, Oracle, SQLServer, Redis are widely used for this purpose. Knowledge of caching mechanisms like varnish, Memcached, Redis is a plus. Server: Exposure to handling Apache, Nginx, IIS servers, Microsoft IIS is desirable. A good background in Linux helps tremendously in administering servers. API (REST & SOAP): Knowledge of web services or API is also important for full stack developers. Knowledge of creations and consumption of REST and SOAP services is desirable.

  <h2>What is Database?</h2>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h4>
    A database is information that is set up for easy access, management and updating. Computer databases typically store aggregations of data records or files that contain information, such as sales transactions, customer data, financials and product information.Databases are used for storing, maintaining and accessing any sort of data. They collect information on people, places or things. That information is gathered in one place so that it can be observed and analyzed. Databases can be thought of as an organized collection of information.What are databases used for?Businesses use data stored in databases to make informed business decisions. Some of the ways organizations use databases include the following:Improve business processes. Companies collect data about business processes, such sales, order processing and customer service. They analyze that data to improve these processes, expand their business and grow revenue.Keep track of customers. Databases often store information about people, such as customers or users. For example, social media platforms use databases to store user information, such as names, email addresses and user behavior. The data is used to recommend content to users and improve the user experience.Secure personal health information. Healthcare providers use databases to securely store personal health data to inform and improve patient care.
    Store personal data. Databases can also be used to store personal information. For example, personal cloud storage is available for individual users to store media, such as photos, in a managed cloud.
